# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# An application for a company that offers to use the services of online language teachers.
## The application consists of 3 pages:
# A “Home” page with a list of company benefits and a link to get started with the app and redirects to the “Teachers” page.
# The "Teachers" page, which contains a list of teachers. After opening the card, you can book a lesson.
# "Favorites" private page with teachers who have been added to "favorites" by the user.
# User registration occurs when a modal window is opened.
