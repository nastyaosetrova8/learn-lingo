# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### An application for a company that offers to use the services of online language teachers.
## The application consists of 3 pages:
### A “Home” page with a list of company benefits and a link to get started with the app and redirects to the “Teachers” page.
